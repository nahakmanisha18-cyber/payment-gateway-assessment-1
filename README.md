## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. User registers an account.
2. Password is securely hashed using **bcryptjs**.
3. User logs into the application.
4. A **JWT token** is generated upon successful login.
5. The token is used to authenticate protected API requests.
6. Token verification logic validates authenticated users via a reusable **`verifyToken.js`** utility.

## 🗄️ Database Models

| Model | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **User** | Stores user account details, credentials, and profile information |
| **Product** | Stores product details such as name, price, description, and images |
| **Cart** | Manages items added to a user's shopping cart |
| **Wishlist** | Manages products saved by a user for later |
| **Order** | Stores order details, including items, status, and payment information |

---

## 🔗 API Structure

The application uses **Next.js API Routes** to handle backend functionality, structured as follows:

```text
/api
├── admin
├── auth
├── cart
├── order
├── payment
├── product
├── user
└── wishlist
```

Each directory contains route handlers responsible for its respective domain (e.g., `auth` handles login/registration, `product` handles product CRUD operations, etc.).
